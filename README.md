### **DevOps Security Demo Project**

**Overview:**
This project is an end-to-end Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that implements DevSecOps principles. The primary objective is to integrate security into the DevOps process, ensuring that security practices are embedded at every stage of the software development lifecycle.

### **Project Description with Implementation Steps**

**1. Setup and Configuration**

**Step 1: Clone the Project Repository**
- Begin by cloning the project's Git repository to your local machine or server.
- Example command:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/NikhilVanka/DevOps-Security-Demo-Project.git
  ```
  
**Step 2: Set Up Maven**
- Ensure Maven is installed on your system, as it will manage dependencies and build the project.
- Use the `mvnw` (Maven Wrapper) scripts provided in the project to run Maven commands without needing to install Maven globally.
  
**Step 3: Review and Configure `pom.xml`**
- The `pom.xml` file contains all the dependencies and build configurations for the project.
- Dependencies include `spring-boot-starter-web` for web functionality and `spring-boot-starter-test` for testing.
- Adjust any properties or dependencies as needed for your environment.

**2. Build and Test the Application**

**Step 4: Build the Application**
- Navigate to the project directory and use Maven to compile the code, resolve dependencies, and package the application.
- Example command:
  ```bash
  ./mvnw install
  ```
- This command will compile the code, run any configured tests, and create a packaged application (JAR or WAR file).

**Step 5: Run Unit Tests**
- Maven automatically runs the unit tests as part of the build process.
- Test results are typically stored in the `target/surefire-reports` directory.
- Review the test results to ensure all tests pass before proceeding.

**3. Continuous Integration with Jenkins**

**Step 6: Set Up Jenkins**
- Install Jenkins on your CI server or use a hosted Jenkins service.
- Install necessary plugins like Maven Integration, Docker, SonarQube, and any others required by the project.

**Step 7: Create a Jenkins Pipeline**
- Use the provided `Jenkinsfile` to set up a Jenkins pipeline.
- The Jenkins pipeline includes the following stages:
  - **Checkout from Git:** Pulls the latest code from the specified branch.
  - **Build & JUnit Test:** Compiles the project and runs unit tests using Maven.
  - **SonarQube Analysis:** Performs static code analysis to identify code quality issues and potential security vulnerabilities.
  - **Build Docker Image:** Builds a Docker image using the `Dockerfile`.
  - **Image Scanning with Trivy:** Scans the Docker image for vulnerabilities.
  - **Push Scan Results to Cloud Storage:** Uploads the Trivy scan report to a cloud storage service for auditing.
  - **Cleanup:** Removes the Docker image to free up space.

**Step 8: Integrate SonarQube**
- Configure SonarQube on Jenkins to analyze the codebase during the pipeline execution.
- Set up a SonarQube server if not already available, and integrate it with Jenkins using the SonarQube plugin.
  
**Step 9: Implement Docker Image Scanning with Trivy**
- Trivy is used to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
- Ensure Trivy is installed on your Jenkins server and configure it within the Jenkinsfile.

**4. Deployment and Security**

**Step 10: Dockerize the Application**
- Use the provided `Dockerfile` to build a Docker image of the application.
- The Dockerfile follows a multi-stage build process, first compiling the application and then creating a slim, production-ready image.

**Step 11: Run Security Scans**
- The pipeline includes a step for scanning the Docker image with Trivy.
- Review the scan results to identify and address any vulnerabilities before deployment.

**Step 12: Store Security Reports**
- Security scan results are uploaded to a cloud storage service, such as Google Cloud Storage, for later review and auditing.
- This step ensures that all security-related data is securely stored and accessible.

---

**5. Cleanup and Maintenance**

**Step 13: Clean Up Docker Images**
- The pipeline includes a cleanup step to remove old Docker images and free up space on the CI server.
- Regular maintenance ensures the CI environment remains clean and efficient.

**Step 14: Monitor and Update**
- Continuously monitor the project for updates to dependencies and security tools.
- Regularly update the CI/CD pipeline to incorporate the latest security practices and tools.

---

**Conclusion:**
This DevOps Security Demo Project provides a comprehensive implementation of CI/CD with integrated security practices. By following these implementation steps, you can ensure that your application is built, tested, and deployed with security at its core, following industry best practices for DevSecOps.
